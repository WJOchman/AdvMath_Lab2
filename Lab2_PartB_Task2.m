% Continuous Time Envelopes and the Nyquist Frequency Range (NFR)

% Job 1: Create a UI with 5 inputs (fundamental_frequency (Hz), sampling_frequency (Hz), start_time (s), stop_time (s), increment (s)).


% Job 2: Trapping mechanics (if and ifelse statements) to make sure the user only enters valid inputs. 


% Job 3: Convert the continuous time signal to a discrete time signal using the defined sampling freuqncy. 


% Job 4: The program must then automatically calculate NFR. The program must inform the user whether the signal is within the NFR or not and act appropriately.


% Job 5: This is insane, needs to be revisited.
