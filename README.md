<h1>Advancted Mathematics Laboratory 2</h1>

<h2>Part A: Data Input & Error Detection</h2>
<li>
  <ul>
    Task 1: Prompt the user to enter a simulation start time, increment, and stop time.<br>
    You will need to:<br>
    <li>
      <ol>Create a title for the dialog box.</ol>
      <ol>Create a variable called 'prompt' to ask the user to enter the start, increment, and stop times.</ol>
      <ol>You may need to adjust the dimensions of your dialog box using the 'dims' command so the user can see the title properly.</ol>
      <ol>Create a variable called 'answer' which will store the three items of data the user enters. Use the 'inputdlg' command to collect this data.</ol>
      <ol>Extract the three entered data from the 'answer' variable and convert it from a string to a number. Use the 'str2num' command to do this. Although when you type something into a dialog box it looks like a number, in fact it is not, it is a string and so we must convert the strings to numbers.</ol>
    </li>
